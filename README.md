# Reservoir with Keras and Tensorflow

The application is an interactive with visualization of neural network, writen in 
Python using Keras, TensorFLow to building network and model, PyQt5 to build GUI and 
some framework of Python like numpy, pandas, scipy...

This app was built to calculation some properties of oil and gas (z, viscosity, formation volume factor ...),
reservoir characteristics (porosity, permeability...)

# Demo app

The Typical tab use to calculate all PVT properties of oil, gas and water from input parameter such as temperature, pressure and specific gravity.

The Artificial tab was build by using neural network architecture to train the input data. Loss of optimization function was display in "LORD RECORD" frame.

The Results tab show results data were predict by model trained before and reliability of model (high $R^2$, low $RMSE$).
