# Reservoir with Keras and Tensorflow

The application is an interactive with visualization of neural network, writen in 
Python using Keras, TensorFLow to building network and model, PyQt5 to build GUI and 
some framework of Python like numpy, pandas, scipy...

This app was built to calculation some properties of oil and gas (z, viscosity, formation volume factor ...),
reservoir characteristics (porosity, permeability...)
